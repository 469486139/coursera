There are several Java client test programs available to test the PA#3
assignment.  One of them is available in this directory.  Another one
(which is designed as a "stress test") is available at

http://users.utcluj.ro/~visoft/teach/posa/

Note that the PA#3 specification allows several implementations, so
these test programs are intended to be used to help simplify your
testing, rather than the "gold standard" for evaluation purposes.
